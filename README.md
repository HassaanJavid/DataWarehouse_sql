## ðŸš€ Project Overview
Part 1: Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)
Goal:
Create a modern data warehouse using SQL Server that brings together sales data from different systems for better reporting and decision-making.

## Key Details:

Data Sources: Load data from two systems (ERP and CRM), both provided as CSV files.

Data Cleaning: Fix any issues in the data before analysis.

Data Integration: Combine both sources into one clean and easy-to-use data model for reporting.

Project Scope: Work only with the latest data; keeping historical records is not required.

Documentation: Include clear explanations of the data model for both business users and analytics teams.

## Part 2: BI, Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)
Goal:
Use SQL to create reports and analytics that provide insights into:

Customer Behavior
